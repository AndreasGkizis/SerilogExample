# Serilog Implementation in Minimal API project (C#)
---

### Details about thisbranch
























Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd your-repo

    Build the project:

bash

dotnet build

    Run the application:

bash

dotnet run

The API will be hosted at http://localhost:5000.
Logging with Serilog

This project uses Serilog as the logging library to capture application logs. The logging configuration is set up in the Program.cs file.
Configuration

In the Program.cs file, the ConfigureLogging method is used to set up Serilog with a simple console sink:

csharp

using Serilog;
using Serilog.Events;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Override("Microsoft", LogEventLevel.Warning)
            .Enrich.FromLogContext()
            .WriteTo.Console()
            .CreateLogger();

        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
        // Other application configurations...
        // ...
        // ...
        builder.Build().Run();
    }
}

In this example, we set the minimum log level to Warning for Microsoft loggers, and the logs are written to the console. You can customize the Serilog configuration as per your requirements, such as adding additional sinks, specifying log file paths, etc.
Endpoints

The API exposes the following endpoints:

    GET /api/hello: Returns a simple "Hello, World!" message.

Feel free to extend this API with additional endpoints and business logic as needed.
